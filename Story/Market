    **[Inquire about the lie]
    YOU: So why did you blatantly lie to me when I was at the stand?
    HER: I'm just trying to survive I'm not one of them. If they figure out who I am, they will...

    **[Listen patiently]
    HER: The melons, the oranges, the crowd, the news...
    everything!
    HER: The amount of lies in this world is beyond imaginable... You can never see the truth.
    HER: Only once did I ever try to believe for the better.
    My little Jacob was such a good little boy...
    - -YOU: "Was" ?
    ->TheTruth

=TheTruth 
HER: It was me and my brother at the start, he was smaller than me and naive at times. 
HER: He always believed.He thought even in this crowd there you can find good, if you are honest and kind to others. 
HER: It was a nice thing to believe in, even I tried it and it made me feel calm, less tense and less nervous. Sometimes its relieveing to say the truth. But not always...
*[Continue listening]
HER: One day, a kid, around age 16-17 approached my fruit stand and asked me for help.
HER: He was in shock, and in my life never seen such a confused, yet terrified of something he doesn't realise, boy
HER: Until I met you...
    **[What about me?]
    HER: You're different...
    HER: If I helped him out sooner maybe he would still be alive, whoever he was...
    **[That sounds like deja vu]
    HER: Maybe..
    HER: But it happens everyday. Everyday is the same...
-HER: As usual, my coward self didn't let me help the poor kid, but only for the purpose of our own safety, yet at cost of his life...
HER: I did everything for our safety.. anything just to blend in and live another miserable day here
HER: But Jacob... His good soul was the burden of him, and eventually me..
HER: He gave the boy real fruits and a basket of them. He went off happy, not suspecting a thing.
*[Continue listening]
HER: It was just some friendly people helping out a poor kid, in his persepctive.
YOU: But what's wrong with that?
HER: As I rejected to help him, I went to the back to bring in more oranges, because they were sold out..
HER: As I head to the back, Jacob talks to the boy and tells him something he shouldn't have heard...
HER: And gave him some fruit to run away with. As he panicked and tried to run for it, someone was watching it all...
HER: They took my little Jacob.. and the other boy was never to be seen again...
    **[Continue listening]
    HER: I came back and no one was there...
    HER: Everything was back to normal, apart from everything...
    YOU: Well, what did you do? They musn't have gotten far?
    HER: If I made any moves, they would have had me there with them... God saved me then, but I lost hope ever since...
    HER: I was in deep grief, I was helpless and coudln't do anything, but sell these stupid fake fruits!
        ***[Continue listening]
        HER: All I could do was sit quiet and watch...
        HER: Watch for the ones who watched...
        HER: And I found a pattern, all these years it was happening right in front of my stand...
        HER: We need to clarify some stuff...
        YOU: Like what?
        HER: How long have you been awake?
            ****[I do not know]
            HER: Well if you don't know, that means you don't remember anything right?
            YOU: Of course I don't, but what does that have to do with anything?
            YOU: I might have just hit my head and fell over, for all I know.
            HER: At the start everyone thinks like that, but I see you're different from the other ones.
            YOU: What do I do?
            ****[I just woke up]
            HER: If you just woke up that means you were the next one.
            HER: You caused a fault in their operation, which means they will be searching for you, if they find you with me... It's over.
            YOU: So what do I have to do?
            ----HER: You have to blend in somehow... 
            HER: Here, put this cloak on and take my bike, forget about me, I can't be saved...
            HER: I noticed they lure you in with them while you don't understand what the heck is going on, but when you do it'll probably be too late..
            HER: The good thing is now you know what's going on.. Use it to your advantage.
            HER: Oh..Someone is at the stand. I have to go! Quick..
            TAKE MY BIKE AND RUN!

            As you take back your stuck cloak the lid makes a slight noise for them to notice it.
            Voice 2: Hey what was that?

            Voice 2: Check the bin while I walk around the perimeter

            You have to cover yourself. 
            ****[Bury yourself in rubbish]
            Voice 2: Hey what was that rustling noise? 
            HER: It's probably the wind blowing the rubbish.

            Voice 2: Hey! Open that bin up and show me what's there then!

            Voice 1: No rats in here...
            HER: Maybe they were over there.
            The lid got closed and they start to walk away.
                *****[Get out]
                You get out trying not to make any noise and make a run for it with the bike...
                As you ride away you hear distant thuds and fruits falling down.
                You can only imagine what is happening...

                *****[Stay a bit longer]
                You hear the footsteps distancing themselves away from you
                You can't make anything out of the converstation but you can hear cries and the words "PLEASE NO"
                Suddenly everything stopped, no noise, no cires..
                SILENCE...
                You get out of the bin, remove the orange peels from your cloak.
                 ******[Peek to the front]
                 You sneaked up along the wall to peek to the front of the stand and...
                NOTHING...
                You get on the bike, in terror. You cycle away from the market as fast as you can, but you can't get the cries out of your head...

You have been cycling for a long time and you've reached the outskirts of the city 
You are really tired and hungry
You need to find a place where you can eat
    **[Rest a while]
    You have an orange in your pocket, what a discovery!
    You start to peel it and enjoy the fruit.
    For the first time today you feel like you can rest and enjoy a short moment of life, as you look into the sunset.
    As you put the first slice into your mouth, you notice a car drive by you, and a boy is sittin on the back seat looking at you.
    You notice something unusual about his face expression
    ->FollowTheCar
    **[Continue riding]
    You continue riding on your last breath, when suddenly an orange falls out of your pocket.
        ***[Stop and pick it up]
        You stop the bike and go on the middle of the road to go and pick it up.
        You see it got mushed a bit from the fall but it's still edible. You go to pick it up but notice a car coming at you with speed.
        You can't pick it up now so you wait get out of the way.
        (SPLUSH!)
        "What a jerk!" you rage to yourself as the car ran over the only food you had. "As if he didn't have the whole road to drive on..."
        ***[Continue riding]
        You drive away and notice a car coming behind you
        You move more to the right for safety
        The car tires skid a bit and you hear a screetch behind you. The driver thankfuly managed to avoid hitting you.
        YOU: It must have been the orange that fell out of my pocket..
        That could have ended badly...
        ---As the car passed you saw a boy on the front seat staring at you with the most scared eyes you've ever seen...
        ->FollowTheCar



=FollowTheCar
*[Continue reading]
You decide to follow the car and you think to yourself:
"What if that boy needs my help?"
"What if he was the next one as she said?"
The road is long and curvy and you see it goes right around the field.
"Maybe if I run across the corn field I will cut the distance and catch them in time?"
    **[Run across the field]
    You ditch the bike and start running as fast as your legs can take you.
    You see the car is already half way though the turn.
    You're already exhausted and your hope of cathing up to the car was fading away when suddenly...The car stops.
    It stopped at the petrol station.
    You realize: "He probably stopped to fuel up the car, but I don't know if I will manage before he gets back."
    You continue running as fast as you can.
    You see the man leaving the car and heading for the building.
    The boy is still there!
    You wave at the boy to catch his attention.
    He looks at you in shock
         ***[Continue reading]
         You keep on running, but as soon as you were about to cross the road you see the man exit the store.
         The kid is in shock as he drops the folder he took from the glove compartment and the driver enters the car..
         You can't do anything, or else the man will catch you...
        The man entering the car was furious at the little kid... probably because he was looking through his stuff.
        You were too late..
        And the car went off.
        Now you are all alone, in the middle of nowhere.
        Living in this cruel world.
        But you are free, free from anyone to tell you what to do next...
        ->AloneEnding
    **[Ride along the road]
    You continue riding the bike, with your second breath taking into action, you put all your force in each pedal spin.
    The car is starting to get away, and it seems like you will never catch it. When suddenly it stops..
    It stopped at the petrol station, but you don't know if you will manage before he gets back... 
    It seems he's searching for something in the car so you have some time to catch up.
    You see the man heading for the building, at the last 200 meters you ditch the bike and run towards the car.
    You get up to the car and the kid notices your presence, but tries to hide.
        ***[Carefully open the door]
        You try to open the door, but its closed...
        The kid is looking at you in dispair...
        ***[Knock on the window]
        You knock on the window.. but no reply from the boy
        ---YOU: Hey kiddo, open up the window, I can help you!
        The kid winds down the window.
        As he opens up the window, a mini bus parks the car to the next petrol tank and blocks the view from the shop.
        You don't have a lot of time till he comes back and you won't see him coming.
            ****[Abandon the kid]
            
            YOU: This man is evil! You need to be careful out there...

            YOU: He's not your uncle.. you have to believe me.
            HIM: But what will he do to me?
            YOU: I don't know, all I know is that I escaped him and now I'm just trying to warn you.
            HIM: But how can you leave me then?

            HIM: But he's my uncle he said..

            He looked at the mirror and at you.
            He did that a couple of times and then in a trembling voice said:

                    (CLING)
                    The shop door opens and you hear the man coughing and walking towards the car.
                    You push the kid to hide behind the van and jump through the car window, closing it as soon as you hit the seat.
                    The kid looks at you in terror as the man walks up to the car.
                    MAN: Hey, what do you think you're doing?!
                    MAN: Why did you open the window?
                    ********[I was car sick]
                    HIM: Better not throw up all over the car...
                    YOU: No, don't worry, I'm better now...
                    ********[I like the smell of petrol that's all]
                    HIM: You maniac.. Wanna die sooner?
                    YOU: It's not that bad...
                    --------HIM: Let's go home now... You ready?

*[But where's home?]
YOU: But where's home?
HIM: You'll see...

*[Stay quiet]
YOU: ...
HIM: I'll take that as a yes. 

-You start driving and see the kid in the cloak staring at you the whole way until you lost sight of him...

=AloneEnding
You ride your bike and end up far away from the city.
You are in a very closed out neighbourhood.
You cautiously ride along the road and notice a house, a house that stands out from the rest...
Escpecially due to the fact that the second floor window was broken and shattered all over the ground.
"I wonder what happened here...", you think to yourself and you continue riding far far away from this place, hiding in the shadows of the world, away from the lies and hate...
*[Conclusion]
You left the child scared and vulnerable, he took your advice on taking risks in the hope of getting away but wasn't able to survive. You escaped the people pursuing you, but you haven't found out the answers to your questions.
->END
