    **[Listen patiently]
    HER: The melons, the oranges, the crowd, the news...
    everything!
    HER: The amount of lies in this world is beyond imaginable...

    HER: Only once did I ever try to believe for the better
    My little Jacob was such a good little boy
    - -YOU: Was?
    ->TheTruth

=TheTruth
HER: It was me and my brother at the start, he was smaller than me and naive at times
He always believed
HER: He thought even in this crowd there you can find good, if you be honest and kind to others
HER: It was a nice thing to believe in, even I tried it and it made me feel calm, less tense and nervous
HER: Sometimes its relieveing to say the truth
But not always...
*[Continue listening]
HER: One day, a kid, around age 16-17 approached my desk and asked me to help him
HER: He was in shock and in my life never seen such a confused yet terrified of something he doesn't realise
HER: Until I met you...
    **[What about me?]
    HER: You're different...
    If I helped him out sooner maybe he would still be alive, whoever he is
    **[That sounds like deja vu]
    HER: Maybe..
    But it happens everyday
    Everyday is the same...
-HER: As usual, my coward self didn't let me help the poor kid, for the purpose of our own safety and  cost of his life
HER: I did everything for our safety.. anything just to blend in and live another miserable day here
HER: But Jacob...
His good soul was the burden of him, and eventually me..
HER: He gave the boy real fruits and a basket of them
He went off happy, not suspecting a thing
*[Continue listening]
HER: It was just some friendly people helping out a poor kid, in his persepctive
YOU: But what's wrong with that?
HER: As I rejected to help him, I went to the back to bring in more oranges, because they were sold out
HER: As I head to the back, Jacob talks to the boy and tells him something he shouldn't have heard
HER: And gave him some fruit to run away with
As he panicked and tried to run for it someone was watching it all
HER: They took my little Jacob.. and the other boy was never to be seen again...
    **[Continue listening]
    -I came back and noone was there
    HER: Everything was back to normal, apart from everything...
    YOU: Well, what did you do? They musn't have gotten far?
    HER: If I made any moves, they would have had me there with them... God saved me then, but I lost hope ever since
    HER: I was in deep grief, but I was helpless and coudlnt do anything but sell these stupid fake oranges!
        ***[Continue listening]
        HER: All I could do was sit quiet and watch...
        Watch for the ones who watched 
        HER: And I found a pattern, all these years it was happening right in front of my stand
        HER: We need to clarify some stuff...
        How long have you been awake?
            ****[I do not know]
            Well if you dont know, that means you don't remember anything right?
            Of course I don't, but what does that have to do with anything
            I might have hit my head and fell over
            HER: At the start everyone thinks like that
            I see you're different than the other ones
            YOU: What do I do
            ****[I just woke up]
            If you just woke up that means you were the next one
            You caused a fault in their operation, which means they will be searching for you, if they find you with me...
            It's over
            YOU: So what do I have to do?
            ----You have to blend in somehow 
            Here, put this cloak on and take my bike, forget about me, I can't be saved
            I noticed they lure you in with them while you don't understand what the hell is going on
            But when you do it'll probably be too late..
            The good thing is now you know what's going on 
            Someone is at the stand I have to go
            TAKE MY BIKE AND RUN!

                *****[Get out]
                You get out trying not to make any noise and make a run for it with the bike...
                As you ride away you hear distant thuds and fruits falling down

                You hear the footsteps distancing themselves away from you
                You can't make anything out of the converstation but you can hear cries and the words PLEASE NO
                Suddenly everything stopped, no noise, no cires
                SILENCE...
                You get out of the bin, remove the orange peels from your cloak
                 ******[Peek to the front]

You are really tired and hungry
You need to find a place where you can eat
    **[Rest a while]
    You have an orange in your pocket, what a discovery
    You start to peel it and enjoy the fruit
    For the first time today you feel like you can rest and enjoy a short moment of life as you look into the sunset
    As you put the first slice into your mouth you notice a car drive by you and a boy is sittin on the back seat looking at you
    You notice something unusual about his face expression
    ->FollowTheCar
    **[Continue riding]
    You continue riding.. You're on your last breath and an orange falls out of your pocket
        ***[Stop and pick it up]
        You stop the bike and go on the middle of the road to go and pick it up
        You see it got mushed a bit from the fall but it's still edible. You go to pick it up but notice a car coming
        You can't pick it up now so you wait for the car to pass
        (SPLUSH!)
        What a jerk!
        Ran it over as if he didn't have the whole road to drive on
        ***[Continue riding]
        You drive away and notice a car coming behind you
        You move more to the right for safety
        The car tires skid a bit and you hear a screetch behind you..The driver thankfuly managed to avoid hitting you
        YOU: It must have been the orange that fell out of my pocket..
        That could have ended badly...
        ---As the car passed you saw a boy on the front seat staring at you with the most scared eyes you've ever seen

*[Continue reading]
You decide to follow the car
What if that boy needs my help?
What if he was the next one as she said?
The road is long and curvy and you see it goes right around the field
Maybe if I run across the corn field I will cut the distance and catch them in time?
    **[Run across the field]
    You ditch the nike and start running as fast as your legs can take you.
    You see the car is alreadyt half way though the turn
    You're already exhasted and it's as if hope is fading away when suddenly
    The car stops
    It stopped at the petrol station, but you don't know if you will manage before he gets back 
    You continue running as fast as you can
    You see the man leaving the car and heading for the building
    The buy is still there!
    You wave at the boy to catch his attention
    He looks at you in shock
         ***[Continue reading]
         You keep on running and as soon as you get up to the road you see the man exit the store
         The kid is in shock as he drops the folder he took from the glove compartment and the driver enters the car..
         You can't do anything, or else the man will catch you...
        You were too late..
        And the car went off
        Now you are all alone, in the middle of nowhere
        Living in this cruel world
        But you are free, free from anyone to tell you what to do next...
        ->DONE
    **[Ride along the road]
    You continue riding the bike with your 2nd breath taking intto action all your force in each pedal spin
    The car is starting to get away, and it seems like you will never catch it
    When suddenly it stops..
    It stopped at the petrol station, but you don't know if you will manage before he gets back 
    It seems he's searching for something in the car so you have some time to catch up
    You see the man heading for the building and now at the last 200 meters you ditch the bike and run towards the car
    You get up to the car and the kid notices your presence but tries to hide it
        ***[Carefully open the door]
        You try to open the door, but its closed...
        The kid is looking at you in dispair...
        ***[Knock on the window]
        You knock on the window.. but no reply from the boy
        ---YOU: Hey kiddo, open up the window, I can help you!
        The kid winds down the window
        As he opens up the window a mini bus parks the car to the next petrol tank and blocks the view from the shop... 
        You don't have a lot of time till he comes back

                    YOU: Take my cloak so they won't recognise you and bike to get away. It's back down the road you will find it
                    CLING
                    The shop door opens and you hear the man coughing and walking towards the car
                    You push the kid to hide behind the van and jump through the car window, closing it as soon as you hit the seat
                    The kid looks at you in terror as the man walks up to the car
                    Hey, what do you think you're doing
                    Why did you open the window
                    ********[I was car sick]
                    HIM: Better not throw up all over the car...
                    YOU: No, don't worry, I'm better now...
                    ********[I like the smell of petrol that's all]
                    HIM: You maniac..
                    Wanna die sooner?
                    YOU: It's not that bad...
                    --------HIM: Let's go home now...
                    ->GoingHomeWithTheCar

*[But where's home?]
YOU: But where's home?
Uncle Ben: ....

*[Stay quiet]
