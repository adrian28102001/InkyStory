You get up from the ground and turn away from the strangers and avoid being suspicious 
As you walk up to a stand of fruits a woman asks you:
HER: Hello, what do you want to buy from our lovely variety of sweet juicy fruits today?
Her voice was so quiet and dulled out by every other noice in the market,especially the distant conversation of the two men

*[Ignore the woman]
You ignore the womans kind attitude and listen in to the conversation which caught your attention instead
Voice 1: What a petty decision he made last time, sadly didn't survive
Voice 2: Yeah

        ***[1 for every lie in this city]
        HER: You have enough money for all of that? I don't think so...
        Stranger: I do...

        YOU: Give us 10 melons in a box 
        and put them in the car, I'll give you a ride kiddo

        YOU: Who even are you? I don't accept stuff from strangers
        He looks at you in a slight shock
        HIM: So this is how you repay everythingI've ever done for you?
        HIM: I was just trying to make you a surprise

            YOU: ...
            ----Go get the box of melons and put them in the boot will ya
            We'll talk in the car...
            You go to the back where the woman showed you the melons are and take them back to the car
            As you walk to the car the other guy walks up to you and says

They say goodbye to each other and you get inside the car
As you walk up to the car you notice the licence plate number
KI 7734
IN THE CAR:
We have quite a long road ahead
You can take a nap on the back seat if you want
*[Take a nap]
YOU: I'm pretty tired, so I guess I will
You jump over to the back and close your eyes as you look out through the window
As you were driving you ran something over  on the road and you hit your head on the window
You wake up in shock 
BEN: What a maniac!
    **[What happened?]
    BEN: This lunatic walked on the middle of the road like he had some kind of death wish
    **[Stay quite]
    YOU: ...
    --Okay, we're gonna stop here, I need to fill the car
    ->CarScenePetrolStation
*[Refuse]
HIM: As you want
I'm surprised you don't remember your uncle 
    **[Remind me]
    YOU: Um, maybe some glimpses are flashing in the back of my memory
    HIM: Remember the time you went on a school trip and you were car sick so I had to drive 100 miles to get you home
    HIM: Or the time me and you went fishing and you fell into the lake and I had to get you and let go of the promisingly big fish I was about to catch, coz you couldn't reall swim back then
    HIM: Don't worry if you don't remember anything. Everything is fine
    In fact here, take a snack from the back
    ->Point2
    **[Tell me about my parents]
    YOU: SO what happened to my parents?
    ~askedAboutParents = true
    HIM: It was tragic..
    You were with them, and everything was great, you were going on a family vacation...but
    A crazy driver, probably on drugs, was on the road, and he hit your car which was fatal for your parents...
    You were the only one who survived, but with a severe head injury, which caused memory loss
    I was the only family left so I took you in and took care you ever since
    YOU: (In shock)
        ***[Who was he]
        HIM: This was a mustery to me ever since.. I'm sorry you have to hear this but...

        ***[I'm speachless]
        HIM: You have the same reaction every time..
        ---Don't worry
        Everything is fine now
        In fact here take a snack from the back
        ->Point2
        
=Point2
You must be hungry, still some time before we have dinner so...

*[You're quite hungry. Accept]
Take the snack
YOU:
Thanks
Uncle BEN:
This your last meal, eh? haha
YOU
What do you mean? 
Uncle BEN: Oh, I mean is this the last thing you ate?
YOU: Yeah, since I woke up..
Uncle BEN: Don't worry, plenty of food at home
That was weird
Why did he ask if it was my last meal, as if I'm a sentenced prisoner...
    **[Continue]
    As you were about to eat the snack you feel the gas pedal press and the car accelerate, you ran something over on the road and the snack fell to the ground... For fucks sake can you be more careful?
    This was the last snack, now you will be hungry till we get home...
    ***[What happened?]
    BEN: This lunatic walked on the middle of the road like he had some kind of death wish
    ***[Stay quite]
    YOU: ...
    ---Okay, we're gonna stop here, I need to fill the car
    ->CarScenePetrolStation
*[You're quite hungry. Decline]
Refuse the snack
Uncle BEN:
As you want..
Noticed you still have an attitude
YOU: ...
    **[Continue]
    You look outside the window as you exit the city and head down the open road. As you were driving you see a boy on a bike eating an orange and watching the sunset
    Oh how you wished to be in his place, and now you regret refusing the snack because watching that boy eat his orange made you hungry
    You notice the car slowing down
    ***[Why are we slowing down?]
    BEN: Okay, we're gonna stop here, I need to fill the car
    Won't be long

You can look around
Try not to get caught

*[Look around the car]
->Point1

You look outside and in the middle of nowhere see a figure running through the field
towards you
YOU: Strange, maybe he lives nearby?Why is he running here

I. A folder, 
II. Wipes

    **[ Observe the picture]
    The picture looks to be a class photo
    Must be his child somewhere in there or a relative maybe
    So i guess he has a family...
    **[Read leaflet]
    The leaflet is actually a guide on how to pick locks might be useful
    **[Look through folder]
    The folder is full of documents, for the car, insurance, 
    nothing unusual.
