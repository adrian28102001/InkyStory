You get up from the ground and turn away from the strangers and avoid being suspicious 
As you walk up to a stand of fruits a woman asks you:
HER: Hello, what do you want to buy from our lovely variety of sweet juicy fruits today?
Her voice was so quiet and dulled out by every other noice in the market,especially the distant conversation of the two men

*[Ignore the woman]
You ignore the womans kind attitude and listen in to the conversation which caught your attention instead

YOU: Yeah, since I woke up..
Uncle BEN: Don't worry, plenty of food at home
That was weird
Why did he ask if it was my last meal, as if I'm a sentenced prisoner...
    **[Continue]
    As you were about to eat the snack you feel the gas pedal press and the car accelerate, you ran something over on the road and the snack fell to the ground... For fucks sake can you be more careful?

Uncle BEN: As you want..
Noticed you still have an attitude
YOU: ...

    You look outside the window as you exit the city and head down the open road. As you were driving you see a boy on a bike eating an orange and watching the sunset
    Oh how you wished to be in his place, and now you regret refusing the snack because watching that boy eat his orange made you hungry
