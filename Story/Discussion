You get up from the ground and turn away from the strangers and avoid being suspicious 
As you walk up to a stand of fruits a woman asks you:
HER: Hello, what do you want to buy from our lovely variety of sweet juicy fruits today?
Her voice was so quiet and dulled out by every other noise in the market, especially the distant conversation of the two men

*[Ignore the woman]
You ignore the womans kind attitude and listen in to the conversation which caught your attention instead
Voice 1: What a petty decision he made last time, sadly didn't survive
Voice 2: Yeah
Let's see what the next one will be like
Voice 1: I don't know if he's ready yet though

    HIM: It was tragic..
    You were with them, and everything was great, you were going on a family vacation...but
    A crazy driver, probably on drugs, was on the road, and he hit your car which was fatal for your parents...
    You were the only one who survived, but with a severe head injury, which caused memory loss
    I was the only family left so I took you in and took care you ever since
    YOU: (In shock)
        ***[Who was he]
        HIM: This was a mystery to me ever since.. I'm sorry you have to hear this but...

YOU: Yeah, since I woke up..
Uncle BEN: Don't worry, plenty of food at home
That was weird
Why did he ask if it was my last meal, as if I'm a sentenced prisoner...
    **[Continue]
    As you were about to eat the snack you feel the gas pedal press and the car accelerate, you ran something over on the road and the snack fell to the ground... For fucks sake can you be more careful?
    This was the last snack, now you will be hungry till we get home...

Uncle BEN: As you want..
Noticed you still have an attitude
YOU: ...
    **[Continue]
    You look outside the window as you exit the city and head down the open road. As you were driving you see a boy on a bike eating an orange and watching the sunset
    Oh how you wished to be in his place, and now you regret refusing the snack because watching that boy eat his orange made you hungry
    You notice the car slowing down
    ***[Why are we slowing down?]

As you're walking on the empty road, you start to get dizzy and halucinate.
You see a figure approaching you quite quickly.
Your heart starts racing, but you're so tired you can't do anything.

SOMEONE: Hey!
SOMEONE: Get on the bike and let's go!
SOMEONE: I've been hoping I would find you.. 
SOMEONE: Let's get away from here!
    
    You get on the bike with the boy you actually saved from an immenent fate at the petrol station. You are now fighting against the world as one whole, together. Because no one knows what's gonna happen tomorrow...
